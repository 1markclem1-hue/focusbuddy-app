FocusBuddy
A Daily Support App for Students with ADHD & Learning Differences
🌈 What Is FocusBuddy?
FocusBuddy is a simple, friendly tool designed to help you stay organized, start your day with confidence, and get work done without feeling overwhelmed.
 It’s not a planner.
 It’s not a school app.
 It’s a brain buddy that helps you manage life in small, clear steps.
If you have ADHD, learning disabilities, executive-functioning challenges, or just feel scattered sometimes — FocusBuddy is for you.
🌟 What FocusBuddy Helps You Do
✔️ Start Your Day Without Stress
FocusBuddy gives you a short “Start My Day” checklist so you don’t have to remember everything in your head.
 Things like:
Did I pack my bag?


Do I know my first task?


Do I have water/food?


Small steps → Big wins.
✔️ Keep Track of Tasks (Without Getting Overwhelmed)
You can quickly add:
School tasks


Home tasks


Estimated time needed


And check them off when you finish.
 Short, simple lists are ADHD-friendly lists.
✔️ Use a Focus Timer
FocusBuddy includes an easy, no-stress timer
 — perfect for:
Pomodoro (25 min focus + 5 min break)


15-minute bursts


Short breaks
 No complicated options. Just start, pause, reset.


✔️ Plan Good Breaks
Your brain needs breaks — but the right kind.
FocusBuddy suggests short break ideas like:
Stretching


Breathing exercises


Mini walks


Music resets


Doodling


Breaks that actually recharge your brain.
✔️ Check In With Your Feelings
ADHD isn’t just about focus — emotions matter too.
FocusBuddy lets you:
Pick your mood


Write what you’re feeling


Reflect on what you might need


It’s private. Just for you.
✔️ Study Helper Spaces (Future Feature!)
FocusBuddy includes two spaces for schoolwork:
Reading Helper: paste text you want simplified


Math Helper: write problems you want help with


These are placeholders for future AI support — but you can still use them now to organize thoughts.
🧠 Why FocusBuddy Works for ADHD Brains
FocusBuddy is built on strategies that actually help ADHD brains:
Short lists instead of long overwhelming ones


Visual structure rather than mental juggling


Timers that reduce anxiety


Breaks built into the workflow


Emotion check-ins to prevent shutdowns


Fast input, low friction design


Everything is made to reduce cognitive load and boost confidence.
